## Tips and tricks

2. Double tap group header to collapse all groups. This will switch all your collection to the compact mode.
3. In compact mode: tap on icon of the group (first in a row) to expand this group. ![](images/pikidex-compact-tap-zone.webp)
4. Double tap icon of the group to expand all groups. This will switch all your collection to the regular mode.
